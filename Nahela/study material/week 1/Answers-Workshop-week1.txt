TASK 1.
What is the probability of not having measles given that a person has a rash? 
In other words, P(⌐m|r) = P(¬m, r) / P(r) = 0.8 / 0.9 = 0.888

What is the probability of having measles given that a person has a rash? 
In other words, P(m|r) = P(m, r) / P(r) =  0.1 / 0.9 = 0.111



TASK 2a. Answer provided in the workshop brief.

TASK 2b.
We know the following from the brief:
P(d)=1/10000=0.0001
P(t|d) =0.99
P(¬t|¬d) =0.95

We are asked to calculate P(d|t). Using the Bayes rule we know that
P(d|t)= ( P(t|d)*P(d) ) / P(t)

We don't know P(t) but from marginal probabilities we know that P(t)=P(t,d)+P(t,-d).

From joint probabilities and the product rule we know that
P(t,d)=P(t|d)*P(d)=0.99*0.0001=0.000099
P(t,-d)=P(t|-d)*P(-d)=0.05*0.9999=0.049995

Thus, P(t)=P(t∧d)+P(t∧-d)=0.000099+0.049995=0.050094

Finally, we can now calculate the P(d|t) as follows:
P(d|t)=( P(t|d)*P(d) ) / P(t)=(0.99*0.0001)/0.050094=0.00198
